# OCT_Segmentation

# Project Title
Automated outer retinal bands segmentation in healthy subjects by deep convolutional neural networks

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Masked Autoencoder pretraining pipeline for OCT imaging, designed to improve the initialization and downstream performance of segmentation networks such as U-Net, DRU-Net, SegResNet, and U-Net++. The project explores how self-supervised learning can leverage large, unlabeled B-scan datasets to learn rich, structure-aware representations of retinal morphology before supervised segmentation.
